> Consider two teams, A and B, playing a series of games until one of the teams wins n games. Assume that the probability of A winning a game is the same for each game and equal to p, and the probability of A losing a game is q = 1-p (Hence, there are no ties.) Let P(i, j) be the probability of A winning the series if A needs i more games to win the series and B needs j more games to win the series.
>
> a. Set up a recurrence relation for P(i, j) that can be used by a dynamic programming algorithm.
>
> b. Find the probability of team A winning a seven-game series if the probability of it winning a game is 0.4.
>
> c. Write pseudocode of the dynamic programming algorithm for solving this problem and determine its time and space efficiencies.

### a

Since the last game is either won by team A or by team B, so P(i, j) can be deduced by P(i-1, j) and P(i, j-1). P(i,j) means  the probability of A winning the series if A with i and B with j, and this only happens when A wins the next game(so A needs to win i-1 games next) or B wins the next game(so B needs to win j-1 games next).

With the probability of A winning a game is equal to p, so the **recurrence relation** is as follows:

$$
P(i,j)= pP(i-1,j)+(1-p)P(i,j-1),\qquad i,j>0
$$
And the initial state is as follows:
$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
 P(i,0)=0, \qquad0<i<n,\\
P(0,j)=1,\qquad 0<j<n
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$
where n is the number of a game.

So the probability of team A winning the n games is $$P(n,n)$$.
### b

According to the solution a, we have the initial state as follows with n=4 since both A and B need to win 4 games, so we need to calculate $$P(4,4)$$.

And we have the initial state as follows:
$$
P(i,0)=0, 0<i<4,\\
P(0,j)=1,0<j<4
$$
We have the recurrence relation as follows with p=0.4:
$$
P(i,j)= 0.4P(i-1,j)+0.6P(i,j-1),\qquad i,j>0
$$
Based on the above two formulas, we can write recursive tables as follows:

| P(i,j) | 0    | 1      | 2     | 3     | 4        |
| ------ | ---- | ------ | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| 0      |      | 1      | 1     | 1     | 1        |
| 1      | 0    | 0.4    | 0.64  | 0.784 | 0.87     |
| 2      | 0    | 0.16   | 0.352 | 0.525 | 0.663    |
| 3      | 0    | 0.064  | 0.179 | 0.317 | 0.456    |
| 4      | 0    | 0.0256 | 0.087 | 0.179 | 0.289792 |

So the probability of team A winning the 4 games in seven-game series is $$P(4,4)=0.289792.$$
### c

Based on the analysis of the problem a, we can directly write the pseudocode as follows:

```pseudocode
GetProbability(n,p)
//Input: games n, probability of A winning one game p
//Output: the probability of team A winning n games
Begin

//dp[i][j] means the probability of A winning
for var i 1 to n by 1
	dp[i][0]=0
for var j 1 to n by 1
	dp[0][j]=1

for var i 1 to n by 1
	for var j 1 to n by 1
		dp[i][j]=p*dp[i-1][j]+(1-p)*dp[i][j-1]
	end
end

return dp[n][n]
End
```

According the pseudocode above, we can see the main time is spent on the loop. So the time efficiency is $$O(n^2)$$.

By solving this problem in dynamic programming, we use dp to solve the result. So the space efficiency is $$O(n^2)$$.

### a

The procedure of Prim's Algorithm is as follows:

> 1. Input: a weighted connected graph, where the vertex set is V and the edge set is e;
> 2.  initialization:  $V_{new}$ = {x}, where x is any node (starting point) in the set V, $E_{new}$ = {}, which is empty;
> 3.  Repeat until $V_{new}$ = V:
>    a. In the set E, select the edge with the smallest weight < u, v >, where u is an element in the set $V_{new}$, and V is not in the $V_{new}$ set, and v ∈ V (if there are multiple edges with the same weight that meet the above conditions, then you can select any one of them);
>    b. Add v to $V_{new}$ and < u, v > edge to $E_{new}$;
> 4. Output: Use $V_{new}$ and $E_{new}$ to describe the minimum spanning tree.

The procedure in this problem is as follows:

The cost of MST is 99.

### b

The procedure of Kruskal's Algorithm is as follows:

> 1. Consider graph G as a forest, and each vertex is an independent tree;
> 2. Add all edges to set S, that is, S=E at the beginning;
> 3. Take out the shortest edge <u, v> from S. if <u, v> is not in the same tree, connect u, V and merge the two trees. At the same time, add <u, v>to the edge set E of spanning tree;
> 4. Repeat 3 until all points belong to the same tree, and the edge set E' is a minimum spanning tree.

The procedure in this problem is as follows:
