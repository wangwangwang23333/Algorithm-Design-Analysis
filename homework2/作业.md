### Insertion Sort

The process of arranging in descending order by insertion sort is as follows:

**Note: light shadows represent sorted numbers while dark shadows represent sorting numbers.**

The code of insertion sort is as follows (Notice: I use binary insertion sort here):

```c++
void binaryInsertSort(int *p, int n){
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i){
        int begin = 0, end = i;
        int temp = p[i];
        while (begin < end){
            int mid = (begin + end - 1) / 2;
            if (temp > p[mid]) // a[mid]较大，在左侧找
            	end = mid;
            else 
                begin = mid + 1;
        }
        for (int k = i - 1; k >= begin; k--){
            p[k + 1] = p[k];
        }
        p[begin] = temp;
    }
}

```

The time complexity is $$O(N^2)$$, and the capacity complexity is $$O(1)$$.

### Quick Sort

The process of arranging in descending order by quick sort is as follows:

![](https://www.hualigs.cn/image/607eb632a424c.jpg)

The code of quick sort is as follows:

```c++
void _quickSort(int *a, int begin, int end){
    if (end - begin < 2)
    	return;
    int i = begin, j = end - 1;
    //哨兵
    int pivot = a[i];
    while (i != j){
        while (i < j && a[j] <= pivot) j--;
        a[i] = a[j];
        while (i < j && a[i] >= pivot) i++;
        a[j] = a[i];
    }
    a[i] = pivot;
    _quickSort(a, begin, i, data);
    _quickSort(a, i + 1, end, data);
}
```

The time complexity is $$O(Nlog_2N)$$, and the capacity complexity is $$O(log_2N)$$.

### Binary Search

The basic idea of binary search for decrement arrays is that if the element viewed currently is smaller than the target element, then we can discard all elements on the right directly; if the element viewed currently is larger than the target element, then we can discard all elements on the left directly. By doing so, we can discard half of the current elements each time, which makes the time complexity $$O(log_2N)$$.

- non-recursive algorithm

  ```c++
  int binarySearch(int *p,int n,int target) {
      int mid;
      int start = 0,end = n - 1;
      while (start <= end) {
          mid = (end - start) / 2 + start;
          if (key > p[mid]) {
              end = mid - 1;
          }
          else if (key < p[mid]) {
              start = mid + 1;
          }
          else {
              return mid;
          }
      }
      return -1;
  }
  ```

  

- recursive algorithm

  ```c++
  int binarySearch(int *p,int n,int target,int start,int end) {
      int mid = (end - start) / 2 + start;
      if (start > end) {
          return -1;
      }
      if (target > p[mid]){
          return  binarySearch(p,n,target,start,mid - 1);
      }
      else if (target < p[mid]) {
          return binartySearch(p,n,target,mid + 1,end);
      }
      else {
          return mid;
      }
  }
  ```

  

### Searching Process

Firstly after sort, the arrays of {13,15,124,28,44,28,27,5,71} is {124,71,44,28,28,27,15,13,4}.

## 2

When the start node is the only one explored, the upper bound is **infinite**, since none of the goal node has been found.

As we continue to explore the node, the procedure is as follows:

| Exploring Node | active node | QUEUE          | GOAL fOUND |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| a(3)           | b(3),c(4)   | b(3),c(4)      | -          |
| b(3)           | e(5),f(3)   | f(3),c(4),e(5) | -          |
| f(3)           | -           | c(4),e(5)      | f          |

So the node **f** is the first goal node found by Branch&Bound.

After the first goal node is found immediately, the upper bound is **3**.

The second goal is not found by Branch&Bound since every node in queue after finding node f is **no less** than upper bound 3.
